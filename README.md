## üìä Example Queries

1. **Find all Sailors with Reservations**  
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT S.SailorName
    FROM Sailor_T S
    JOIN Reserves_T R ON S.SailorID = R.SailorID;
    ```

2. **List Boats with Their Reservations**  
    ```sql
    SELECT B.BoatType, R.Day
    FROM Boat_T B
    JOIN Reserves_T R ON B.BoatID = R.BoatID;
    ```

3. **Calculate Total Rental Cost for Each Sailor**  
    ```sql
    SELECT S.SailorName, COUNT(R.BoatID) * S.RatePerDay AS TotalCost
    FROM Sailor_T S
    JOIN Reserves_T R ON S.SailorID = R.SailorID
    GROUP BY S.SailorName, S.RatePerDay;
    ```
